# Legacy SQL Migration Files

These SQL files are from the early development phase and have been superseded
by the official Supabase migration system in `supabase/migrations/`.

**DO NOT run these files.** They are kept for historical reference only.

The authoritative schema is defined by the migrations in `supabase/migrations/`.
